This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo. The error message is usually vague, and debugging can be challenging.  It often manifests as an unexpected behavior or silent failure where data isn't stored or retrieved correctly. The root cause may be related to improper usage of AsyncStorage, such as incorrect key handling or race conditions.  Another possibility is a conflict with other libraries or asynchronous operations within the app.
