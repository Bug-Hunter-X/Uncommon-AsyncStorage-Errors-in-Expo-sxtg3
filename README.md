This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using AsyncStorage in Expo applications.  The error is characterized by seemingly unpredictable behavior, where data may not be stored or retrieved, often without providing clear error messages.  The provided code examples showcase the problematic scenario and a solution to address the issue. The solution involves careful handling of asynchronous operations and potential race conditions to ensure data integrity.
